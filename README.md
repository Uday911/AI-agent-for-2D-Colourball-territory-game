# AI-agent-for-2D-Colourball-territory-game Using Pytorch
The Project trains an AI agent to play and win custom made game using pygame library. In this game two color balls will be allowed to move in 8 directions to color the area (200x200 pixel window), the ball which colors more than 70% of total colored area wins.

# Libraries required
Pygame, Pytorch, numpy, random

# Algorithm used
Data gathered by the gameplay between two networks one is playing randomly and another with ongoing training
Categorical crossentropy used
